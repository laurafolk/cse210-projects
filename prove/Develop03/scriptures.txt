1. Philippians 4:13|I can do all things thruogh Christ which strengtheneth me.
2. Alma 32:28|Now, we will compare the word unto a seed.  Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true see, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves-It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.
3. Proverbs 3:5, 6|Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.
